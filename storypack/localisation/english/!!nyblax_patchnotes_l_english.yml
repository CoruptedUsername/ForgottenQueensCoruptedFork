 story_desc: "Latest Update Date: 02/03/2020\n\nThis Patch includes:\nGeneral:\n§R - You can now Balance the universe using the nyblax cube.\n - Lots of typos, reworked art and other story stuff probably nobody will ever notice lol.§!\n - The Nyblax Eye no longer provides a basic 20 planetary sensor range, but +1 influence, active is still the same.\n - Added a trigger that checks every year if player has the nyblax cure to heal infested pops in case an infested refugee arrives or other weird scenario.\n - The interdiction no-ai-leave-federation reduced from 20 years to 15 years.\n - Fallen empires will awaken if players fail to stop the mad collector before he gets all the runes.\n - Awekened empires will leave the interdictors as soon as the intercition war ends but will remain awakened (The rest of the empires will have to sort it out on their own).\n - Awakened fallen empires will expand and behave as they do regularely, they wont get any additional fleets tho (Unlike the sleepers awake event chain).\n - The Raiding Planet modifier from the mad collector is now timed based to prevent cases were it could die while raiding and the modifier would be stuck there.\n\nI would like to thank my Patrons for supporting my work!\n\nIf you like my work and would like to support me so I keep on adding content you can do it by becoming a Patron at: §Bhttps://www.patreon.com/hivemods§!"
