[h1]About the mod and Credits[/h1]

This mod was originally created by [url=patreon.com/hivemods]Complex[/url], but he had to step aside from the project to focus in other new and exciting things. If you wish to show your support for him and his work, you can do so by clicking [url=patreon.com/hivemods]here[/url]


[h1]Features[/h1]
In Pantheons of the Void, you will be able to chose your religious system in the empire creation screen, this selection will determine what your empire supports as faith. Faith or Religious systems have a variety of options to try out, from Atheism to Monotheism to Animatism.

Having pops that believe in other religious systems will cause some pops to start abandoning their work posts to start preaching about their faith.

Heresy Preachers consume their base costs and provide attraction towards said faith system. The faiths attraction in your empire can be found in the new faction window.

One preacher job is added every 10 heretics to a maximum of 10 preachers. So having them in your planets will cause a cascade effect in them. Here comes the council of faiths!

The Council of Faiths Window gives players the necessary tools to deal with heresy. Players will be allowed to chose between two paths, the Flexible Path and the Dogmatic Path, by using their influence. They can even bribe the council to get their support with the mob and get some extra influence in dire times.

The Flexible path is a set of religious traditions that work towards understanding and being flexible about other forms of faith. By doing so, you can tax heresy preachers, create ominist forums or even get some sweet new casus belli against dogmatic empires

Now, if being flexible and all loving is not your thing or The Emperor of Mankind guides you, the dogmatic way is what you are looking for! The Dogmatic path allows you to deal with heresy as the Emperor commands. Ban them, purify them with fire, or brainwash the blasphemous beings into the light. With this path you will also be able to send missionaries to rival empires (that do not have your same faith system).

Missionaries will add a lot of attraction towards your faith system in a random planet of the selected rival. If you send a missionary and the empire has over 55% of pops that follow your religious system, they will be forced to change their system and their ruler will have to abdicate.

OR! you can be MORE aggressive and send your fleets instead! At the end of every path there is a 'Total War' casus belli. Dogmatics will be allowed to 'purge the infidels', while Flexibles will be able to 'crush the souls' of the Dogmatics.


[h1]Current Stage: [b]RE-RELEASE[/b][/h1]
Only regular empires are supported for the time being (support for gestalt and megacorps is planned for the future, as well as new custom religious traditions). Constructive feedback is more than welcome, and I'm always on the lookout for folks willing to help out with adding new ideas/concepts, as well as fixing/polishing the code as-is.

I will not be offering compatibility patches for other mods, but I do intend to keep the code relatively simple and unobtrusive to minimize mod conflicts. However, due to the expansive nature of this mod, some compatibility issues are inevitable, in which case you might need to seek out compatibility patches made by other capable modders on the workshop.
