[h1]About the mod and Credits[/h1]

This mod compiles most of my other mods  into one Unofficial DLC, adding a background I created (with a base from  https://www.deviantart.com/skyrion/art/Hive-709300772), aditional room and portrait from Silfae's and Oskar Potocki ([url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=902526212]Link[/url]) and voice advisor from NotSoBraveDave ([url=steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1328104435]Link[/url])

[h1]Extra Credits[/h1]
I want to thank my best friend Franz for introducing me to Stellaris and playing with me instead of going after girls and my cat, Nalo, for being with me while I mod.
Id also like to thank the discord stellaris mod making den for the help and guidance.
And how to forget about Reddit, best community ever!
